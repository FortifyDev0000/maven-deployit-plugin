Usage

  This page provides general usage information along with a basic example.  The plugin
  is used to deploy a set of artifacts (war, ear, static contents, sql files ...) to an environment in order to
  run a set of tests (functional tests, technical tests, performance tests). This is done during the
  pre-integration-test and pre-integration-test phase.  This is done using <<<{{{deploy-mojo.html} deployit:deploy }}>>> goal.
  The  <<<{{{clean-mojo.html} deployit:clean }}>>> undeploys all what has been deployed in the <<<{{{deploy-mojo.html} deployit:deploy }}>>> goal.
